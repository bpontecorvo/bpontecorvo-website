        <h3 class="book-title"><image src="images/Gucci_Mane.png" class="book_thumbnail"></image>The Autobiography of Gucci Man - Radric Davis, aka Gucci, can tell a story as well as he can write a hit song.  From poverty, violence, prison, drug addiction, to inventing a new genre of music Gucci has lived a crazy life. Love him or hate him, Gucci gives a raw, honest retelling of his life and the crazy shit that happened along the way.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Musicians, Trap Music, ATL, or learning more about the African American experience in the US.   </br>

        <p class="book-text"> Although I do enjoy reading musicians autobigraphys, I recieved this as a birthday gift from a friend.  This book is never boring and fairly well written.  Gucci retells stories coherently but still keeps his voice.  It was awesome to learn about hbis process for creating music, working with Zaytoven to make beats, and where he got his mucical ideas from. There were countless times throughout his life that Gucci easily could have died, it is frankly shocking that he made it out alive.  It also made me wonder how many talented and young minds are killed, only because they are products of the enviroments they grown up in.
