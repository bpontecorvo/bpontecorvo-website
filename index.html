            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Seattle, WA and have since lived in Oregon, Colorado, and Chile.  I learned to rock climb in college and it has become my main passion in life. I also can be found juggling, doing crossword puzzles, listening to podcasts, practicing Spanish, and reading.</p>  
            <p> I currently work in the Geospatial world and really enjoy all aspects of mapping, cartography, and data visualization.  I am slowly-but-surely taking a full stack web development course thru codecademy.com, currently deep in Front End Web Development.</p>
