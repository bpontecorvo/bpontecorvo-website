            <p>I grew up in Seattle, WA, and have since lived in Oregon, Colorado, and Chile.  I learned to rock climb in college, and it has become my main passion in life. I can also be found juggling, doing crossword puzzles, listening to podcasts, practicing Spanish, and walking my neighborâ€™s dogs.
            </br> </br> 
            I currently work in the Geospatial world and enjoy all aspects of mapping, cartography, and data visualization.  I am presently learning Front End Web Dev which is why I am building this site.
