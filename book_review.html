Less memoir, more manual. </br>

            <p class="book-text">Stephen King lays out his process for story creation and writing, initial inspiration, demons, and tips and tricks for being a good writer.  A beautifully woven book which is part memoir, part instruction.  It begins at the early stages of his life, working as a teacher trying to get published, his first success, beating addiction, and getting hit by a van.  You will learn how to build a writers “tool-box”, starting with simple rules like: “Omit needless words”, and "Never use passive voice". <br><br>

                Many of his best stories came from answering simple, horrid, hypotheticals: “What if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog” (<em>Cujo</em>)
                                    
                What I thought he would talk about, which he didn't:
                His book Rage which he purportedly regrets 
                Famous Books: <em>It</em>, <em>The Shinning</em>, <em>Dr. Sleep</em>, <em>Long Walk</em>, <em>Green Mile</em>, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, etc  many others.  
                Did having so many of his works turned into movies make him feel a certain way about the industry?

            <p class="book-text">A complete history of our beloved Southern Resident Killer Whales, from the capture-era to present-day news, is a must-read for any orca or PNW history fanatic.  It is interesting from a biology perspective, as well as just a human policy/interaction viewpoint.  The SKRWs are the most well-understood group of Cetaceans on the planet- we know who everyone's parents, siblings, etc are, what they eat, who is born, and who dies… Yet, even in the most progressive parts of the wealthiest country on Earth, we are unable to enact change that will allow their population to rebound. Thoughtfully written and well researched, this book contains everything the layperson would/could want to know.  While it is possible that they make a comeback, it is unlikely unless they start finding more Chinook Salmon very soon, or else the calves will keep dying.  Some factoids that I jotted down:

                Scientists accidentally killed a SRKW tagging it in 2016.  
                We still don’t really know where they go in winter
                We do not know why Transients and Residents do not interact
                K27 Deadhead was named to honor the passing of Jerry Garcia (term also means floating log).  Her first calf was named Ripple.
                Noise, Pollution, and lack of prey are the main causes of their demis
