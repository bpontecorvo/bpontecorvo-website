            <p>I found that while I was reading alot of books, I was forgetting important details or lessons years later. So I started taking very brief notes as I read. I also needed a good project for doing a bunch of CSS alignment</p>

                        <p>NUDGE- Nobel Prize winning Behavioral Economists write about decision making structures in place throughout our society.  How do we help individuals make better choices when dealing with their taxes, insurance, mortgages, credit cards, and even organ donation and climate change? Get rid of sludge, they say, and create choice architecture with nudges and libertarian paternalism.  It is written in a relaxed, subtle tone with neither author taking themselves too seriously.</p>

                    <p>Stephen King lays out his process for story creation and writing, initial inspiration, demons, and tips and tricks for being a good writer.  A beautifully woven book which is part memoir, part instruction.  It begins at the early stages of his life, working as a teacher trying to get published, his first success, beating addiction, and getting hit by a van.  You will learn how to build a writers ‚Äútool-box‚Äù, starting with simple rules like: ‚ÄúOmit needless words‚Äù, and "Never use passive voice".

                    Many of his best stories came from answering simple, horrid, hypotheticals: ‚ÄúWhat if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog‚Äù (<em>Cujo</em>)
                                        
                    What I thought he would talk about, which he didn't:
                    His book Rage which he purportedly regrets 
                    Famous Books: <em>It</em>>, <em>The Shinning</em>, <em>Dr. Sleep</em>, <em>Long Walk</em>, <em>Green Mile</em>, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, etc  many others.  
                    Did having so many of his works turned into movies make him feel a certain way about the industry? 
                    
                    While <em>On Writing</em> was indeed interesting, I cannot recommend this as just a SK fan- you must really be interested in learning about his process, are a fiction writer yourself, or ran out of other King works to read.

                    <p>A complete history of our beloved Killer Whales, from the capture-era to present day news, a must read for any orca or PNW history fanatic.  It is interesting from a biology perspective, as well as just a human policy/interaction viewpoint.  The Southern Resident Killer Whales are the most well studied group of Cetaceans on the planet- we know who everyone's parent, siblings, etc are, what they eat, who is born, who dies..  Thoughtfully written and well researched, this book contains everything the lay person would/could want to know.  While it is possible that they make a comeback, it is unlikely unless they start finding more Chinook Salmon very soon, or else the calves will keep dying.  Some factoids that I jotted down:

                        Scientists accidentally killed a SRKW tagging it in 2016.  
                        We still don‚Äôt really know where they go in winter
                        We do not know why Transients and Residents do not interact
                        K27 Deadhead was named to honor the passing of Jerry Garcia (term also means floating log).  Her first calf was named Ripple.
                        Noise, Pollution, and lack of prey are the main causes of their demis</p>
