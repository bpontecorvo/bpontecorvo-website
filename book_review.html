            <p class="book-text">Two world-renowned Behavioral Economists write about decision-making structures in place in the private and public sectors. How could we easily help individuals make better choices when dealing with their taxes, insurance, mortgages, credit cards, and even organ donation and climate change? Get rid of sludge, they say, and create choice architecture with Nudges and Libertarian Paternalism. It is written in a relaxed, subtle tone with neither author taking themselves too seriously.

Less memoir, more manual. </br>

            <p class="book-text">Stephen King lays out his process for story creation and writing, initial inspiration, demons, and tips and tricks for being a good writer.  A beautifully woven book which is part memoir, part instruction.  It begins at the early stages of his life, working as a teacher trying to get published, his first success, beating addiction, and getting hit by a van.  You will learn how to build a writers ‚Äútool-box‚Äù, starting with simple rules like: ‚ÄúOmit needless words‚Äù, and "Never use passive voice". <br><br>

                Many of his best stories came from answering simple, horrid, hypotheticals: ‚ÄúWhat if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog‚Äù (<em>Cujo</em>)
                                    
                What I thought he would talk about, which he didn't:
                His book Rage which he purportedly regrets 
                Famous Books: <em>It</em>, <em>The Shinning</em>, <em>Dr. Sleep</em>, <em>Long Walk</em>, <em>Green Mile</em>, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, etc  many others.  
                Did having so many of his works turned into movies make him feel a certain way about the industry?

            <p class="book-text">A complete history of our beloved Southern Resident Killer Whales, from the capture-era to present-day news, is a must-read for any orca or PNW history fanatic.  It is interesting from a biology perspective, as well as just a human policy/interaction viewpoint.  The SKRWs are the most well-understood group of Cetaceans on the planet- we know who everyone's parents, siblings, etc are, what they eat, who is born, and who dies‚Ä¶ Yet, even in the most progressive parts of the wealthiest country on Earth, we are unable to enact change that will allow their population to rebound. Thoughtfully written and well researched, this book contains everything the layperson would/could want to know.  While it is possible that they make a comeback, it is unlikely unless they start finding more Chinook Salmon very soon, or else the calves will keep dying.  Some factoids that I jotted down:

                Scientists accidentally killed a SRKW tagging it in 2016.  
                We still don‚Äôt really know where they go in winter
                We do not know why Transients and Residents do not interact

From poverty, violence, prison, drug addiction, to inventing a new genre of music Gucci has lived a crazy life. Love him or hate him, Gucci gives a raw, honest retelling of his life and the crazy shit that happened along the way.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Musicians, Trap Music, ATL, or learning more about the African American experience in the US.   </br>

            <p class="book-text"> Although I do enjoy reading musicians autobigraphys, I recieved this as a birthday gift from a friend.  This book is never boring and fairly well written.  Gucci retells stories coherently but still keeps his voice.  It was awesome to learn about hbis process for creating music, working with Zaytoven to make beats, and where he got his mucical ideas from. There were countless times throughout his life that Gucci easily could have died, it is frankly shocking that he made it out alive.  It also made me wonder how many talented and young minds are killed, only because they are products of the enviroments they grown up in.

            <p class="book-text">Badass climber Kelly Cordes does his homework and puts together a inticing, capitivating tale of the history that surrounded this mountain.  He also positions the controversial events into their historical context- Italy had suffered shame and defeat after WWII, and needed a hero.  Some "classic" mountaineering books are pretty archaeic and have significantly boring secitions- you will not find that here.  The book is hard cover, has a nice font and spacing making it easy on the eyes, and has rad pictures sprinkled throughout.  Go steal one.

Chapters cover everything from the basics, to floods, storms, coastal weather features, mountain-related phenomena, to snowpack, forest fires, to climate change and weather prediction challenges.  The author walks you through how meteorologists make forecasts, both historically and to this day.  I learned that the weather in the PNW is the MOST PREDICTABLE in the nation.  Some parts are quite dry, but you can just skip them, and some graphics are shockingly low quality and hard to understand.  Unlike his blog, you will find no politics here.
