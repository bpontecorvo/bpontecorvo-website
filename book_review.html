            <p class="book-text">Two world-renowned Behavioral Economists write about decision-making structures in the private and public sectors. How could we quickly help individuals make better choices when dealing with their taxes, insurance, mortgages, credit cards, organ donation, and climate change? Get rid of sludge, they say, and create choice architecture with Nudges and Libertarian Paternalism. It is written in a relaxed, subtle tone, with neither author taking themselves too seriously.

            <p class="book-text">Stephen King lays out his process for story creation and writing, initial inspiration, demons, and tips and tricks for being a good writer.  A beautifully woven book which is part memoir, part instruction.  It begins at the early stages of his life, working as a teacher trying to get published, his first success, beating addiction, and getting hit by a van.  You will learn how to build a writers “tool-box”, starting with simple rules like: “Omit needless words”, and "Never use passive voice". <br><br>

                Many of his best stories came from answering simple, horrid, hypotheticals: “What if a young mother and her son became trapped in their stalled car by a rabid dog” (<em>Cujo</em>.  He does not mention many of my favorites such as <em> Rage</em>, <em>It</em>, <em>The Shinning</em>, <em>Dr. Sleep</em>, <em>Long Walk</em>, <em>Green Mile</em>, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, &  many others.

            <p class="book-text">A complete history of our beloved Southern Resident Killer Whales, from the capture-era to present-day news, is a must-read for any orca or PNW history fanatic.  It is interesting from a biology perspective, as well as just a human policy/interaction viewpoint.  The SKRWs are the most well-understood group of Cetaceans on the planet- we know who everyone's parents, siblings, etc are, what they eat, who is born, and who dies… Yet, even in the most progressive parts of the wealthiest country on Earth, we are unable to enact change that will allow their population to rebound. Thoughtfully written and well researched, this book contains everything the layperson would/could want to know.  While it is possible that they make a comeback, it is unlikely unless they start finding more Chinook Salmon very soon, or else the calves will keep dying.  Some factoids that I jotted down:</br></br>

                -Scientists accidentally killed a SRKW tagging it in 2016.<br>  
                -We still don’t know where they migrate in the Winter. <br>
               -We do not know why Transients and Residents do not interact.<br>
                -K27 Deadhead was named to honor the passing of Jerry Garcia (term also means floating log).  Her first calf was named Ripple.<br>
                -Noise, Pollution, and lack of prey are the main causes of their demise

            <p class="book-text">I received this as a birthday gift from a friend.  This book is never dull and reasonably well written; the author retells stories coherently but still keeps his voice.  It was fantastic to learn about his process for creating music, working with Zaytoven to make beats, and where he got his musical ideas from. There were countless times throughout his life that Gucci quickly could have died; it is frankly shocking that he made it out alive.  It also made me wonder how many talented and young minds are killed only because they are products of the environments they grew up in. I would recommend this to anyone interested in Musicians, Trap Music, ATL, or learning more about the Black experience in the US.

            <p class="book-text">Accomplished climber & author Kelly Cordes does his homework and puts together an enticing, captivating tale of the history that surrounded this mountain.  He also positions the many controversial events in their historical context- (for example Italy had suffered shame and defeat after WWII and needed a hero).  Some "classic" mountaineering books are pretty archaic and have significantly boring sections- you will not find that here.  The book is hardcover, has a nice font and spacing making it easy on the eyes, and has rad pictures sprinkled throughout.  Go get yourself one.

            <p class="book-text"> It is digestible by both the expert and novice weather enthusiast, and you can skip over dull sections.  Chapters cover everything from the basics, to floods, storms, coastal weather features, mountain-related phenomena, to snowpack, forest fires, to climate change and weather prediction challenges.  The author walks you through how meteorologists make forecasts, both historically and to this day.  I learned that the weather in the PNW is the MOST PREDICTABLE in the nation.  Some parts are quite dry, but you can just skip them, and some graphics are shockingly low quality and hard to understand.  Unlike his blog, you will find no politics here.
